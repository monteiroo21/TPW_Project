## Introduction

**CarStand** it's a web based system that allows the management of a vehicle stand. This system is divided into 5 classes: Groups, Brands, Models, Cars and Motos. It allows to check what brands exist in the stand and also the groups that own those brands. For the costumer, it is possible to check which vehicles are available in the stand, add them to his favourites and also show interest in a certain vehicle. The admin, on the other hand, can accept or decline requests from the customers and can also add, remove or edit vehicles.

## Major functionalities
